# Data Structure and Programming

NTUEE Course DSnP 2017 Fall

## Homework 1

Build a .csv reader which supports basic arithmetic operations such as row/column average/maximum/minimum.

## Homework 2

Build a command line reader.

## Homework 3

Build a .csv reader using the command line reader built in Homework 2.

## Homework 4

Build a memory manager.

## Homework 5

Implement three abstract data type: array, doubly-linked list, and binary search tree.

## Homework 6

Build a circuit reader.

## Homework 7
Build hash and heap.

## Final project

Implement a special circuit representation, FRAIG (Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph), from a circuit description file, which supports several functions: remove redundant/unused gates; merge functionally equivalent gates; perform circuit simulations to identify possible functionally equivalent gates (functionally equivalent pairs, FEC), and call the provided SAT(boolean satisfiability problem) solver to prove/disprove whether they are equivalent or not, and finally, merge those which are proven functionally equivalent.
